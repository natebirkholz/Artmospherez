Dutch, 1647. Oil on panel. The landscape here was produced early in the painterâ€™s career and reflects the influence of Jan van Goyen, Hercules Pietersz Segers and Hendrick Goltzius. The perspective is perfect, and the lower-than-usual skyline gives great prominence to the sky. Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza.
