Greek, 1598-9. Oil on canvas.  El Greco portrays the city he lived and worked in for most of his life. The painting belongs to the tradition of emblematic city views, rather than a faithful documentary description. The view of the eastern section of Toledo from the north would have excluded the cathedral, which the artist therefore imaginatively moved to the left of the Alc√°zar (the royal palace).  Metropolitan Museum of Art.
