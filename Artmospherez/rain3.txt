Japanese, 1857. Polychrome woodblock print; ink and color on paper. The sudden shower, a favorite subject of Edo haiku poets and ukiyo-e artists, is often depicted with a crisscrossing pattern of fine lines of rain—a difficult woodblock technique. Here, the netlike pattern is superimposed over an intensely focused image of Ōhashi (the Great Bridge), which crosses the Sumida River. Metropolitan museum of Art.
