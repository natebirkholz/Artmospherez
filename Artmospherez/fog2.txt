British, 1874. Oil on canvas. Sisley painted this fog effect with a hint of a fence in the background, foliage on the left, a tree with twisted branches on the right beneath which a crouching woman seems to be picking flowers. But more than a peasant woman in her garden, the protagonist of the painting is the silvery mist which blurs the shapes and the background into a bluish grey tone. Musée d’Orsay.
